# 📦 Demand Forecasting & Inventory Optimization

This repository presents an end-to-end **machine learning solution** tailored for supply chain professionals. It addresses a common challenge in demand planning: how to **accurately forecast product demand** and use that insight to **optimize inventory levels** — minimizing stockouts and excess while improving service levels.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem

**Real-world Challenge**  
Demand planners and supply chain managers often rely on manual forecasts or spreadsheets. These can’t effectively respond to:
- Promotion periods
- Seasonal changes
- Lead time variability

**Business Impact**  
- ⛔ Stockouts → missed sales  
- 💸 Overstock → wasted cash and warehouse space  
- 😐 Poor service levels → lost customers

---

## ✅ Project Objective

This project uses **machine learning + interactive dashboards** to:
- Predict future demand for individual products
- Quantify inventory needs based on that forecast
- Recommend Safety Stock, Reorder Point, and EOQ
- Visualize and export predictions for decision-making

---

## 🧩 Who Should Use This?

- 📊 **Demand Planners**
- 🧠 **Supply Chain Data Analysts**
- 🏭 **Inventory Managers**
- 🤖 **ML Engineers in Operations or Logistics**

## 🧠 ML Pipeline Overview

### 1. 📌 Problem Definition
- **Task**: Regression – forecast daily product-level demand
- **Success Metrics**: MAE, Forecast Bias, Inventory ROI

### 2. 🧾 Data Collection
- Synthetic historical data with 3 datasets:
  - `sales_data.csv`
  - `product_master.csv`
  - `calendar.csv` (promo/holiday flags)

### 3. 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted in `notebooks/01_eda_full.ipynb` using Seaborn and Matplotlib:
- 📈 Sales trends over time (daily/weekly)
- 🔁 Seasonality and cyclic patterns
- 🛍️ Promo vs non-promo analysis
- 📅 Heatmaps for weekday and month-level demand
- ⭐ Top-selling products overview

### 4. 🧼 Data Preprocessing
Handled using:
- `src/data/load_data.py`
- `src/data/clean_data.py`

Steps included:
- Merging sales, product, and calendar datasets
- Handling missing promo/holiday indicators
- Removing duplicates
- Filtering invalid records (e.g., negative demand)

### 5. 🧱 Feature Engineering
Created in `src/features/build_features.py`, including:
- Lag features (e.g., previous day sales)
- Rolling window statistics (7-day mean and std)
- Date-based fields: day of week, month, year
- Promotion and holiday binary flags

### 6. 🤖 Model Training
- Algorithm: **XGBoost Regressor**
- Trained on 1 year of filtered data (for fast app load)
- Model file: `xgb_model.pkl`

Script: `src/models/train_model.py`

## 💻 Streamlit App

- Forecast chart: actual vs predicted
- KPIs: EOQ, Safety Stock, Reorder Point
- Export: download forecast as `.csv`

---

## 📊 Model Performance Metrics

| Metric           | Value   |
|------------------|---------|
| MAE              | 8.00    |
| RMSE             | 8.37    |
| R² Score         | 0.94    |

🧪 *Metrics calculated using `notebooks/01_01_demand_forecasting_metrics.py` on sample product demand data.*

---

## 📈 Business KPI Impact

- 📉 Reduced stockouts by optimizing reorder triggers  
- 🏷️ Lowered overstock costs through EOQ-based replenishment  
- 📦 Balanced safety stock and lead time for smoother operations
